# ![jenkins](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a854b64-7e42-4941-af78-bea35ccd2f6f) Creating a CI Pipeline with Jenkins  

## Description

This demo project is part of **Module 8: Build Automation & CI/CD with Jenkins** from the **Nana DevOps Bootcamp**. It focuses on creating a Jenkins Shared Library using Groovy to centralize and reuse common CI/CD logic across multiple Jenkins pipelines.  

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- <b>Docker: Docker for containerization.</b>
- <b>Jenkins: Automation for CI/CD.</b>
- <b>Linux: Ubuntu for Server configuration and management.</b>
- <b>Digital Ocean: Cloud provider for hosting Jenkins server.</b>
- <b>GitHub: Source control for Jenkins pipelines and shared libraries.</b>
- <b>DockerHub: private docker repository.</b>
- <b>Maven: Build tool for Java application.</b>
- <b>Nana's Java Application: Java application developed by Nana from the Bootcamp.</b>
- <b>Groovy: Language for pipeline scripting and shared libraries.


## üéØ Features

- <b>Create a separate Git repository for Jenkins Shared Library project.</b>
- <b>Create functions in the Jenkins Shared Library to use in the Jenkins pipeline.</b>
- <b>Integrate the Global library in jenkins pipeline</b>
- <b>Integrate the shared library for a specific project</b>
  

## üìù Prerequisites
- <b>Ensure that the Jenkins is running.</b>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Configuration:

### Creating a Git repository for the Jenkins Shared Library project.
1. Go to your Github Account and create a new repository.

### Creating functions in the Jenkins Shared Library to use in the Jenkins pipeline.
1. Open IntelliJ and create a new Groovy project named jenkins-shared-library.
2. Create a new folder named Vars.
3. Inside the Vars folder, create a Groovy file named buildJar.groovy. Each file in the Vars folder contains a function to be executed by the Jenkinsfile, and the file name must match the function name called from the Jenkinsfile.
4. Ensure buildJar.groovy includes the shebang and function definition, as shown:

   ```bash
   #!/user/bin/env groovy

     def call() {
       echo "building the application for branch $BRANCH_NAME"
       dir('java-maven-app') {
                sh 'mvn package'
       }
   }
   ```
5. Create a separate Groovy file for each function you want to reuse in the Jenkins shared library.
   buildImage.groovy file:
   ```bash
      #!/user/bin/env groovy
   
      def call(String imageName) {
           echo "building the docker Image..."
           withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'docker-hub-repo', passwordVariable: 'PWD', usernameVariable: 'USER')]) {
           sh """
                 cd java-maven-app/
                 docker build -t $ImageName .
                 echo $PWD | docker login -u $USER --password-stdin
                 docker push $ImageName
            """
           }
   } 
   ```
6. Create a new branch for the java-maven-app repository named Jenkins-shared-library.
7. Edit the Jenkinsfile in the java-maven-app repository to call the buildJar.groovy and buildImage.groovy files as shown below:

   ```bash
    stage("build jar"){
             steps{
                 script{
                     buildJar()
                 }
              }
        }

         stage("build Image"){
                     steps{
                         script{
                             buildImage()
                         }
                     }
         }
   
   ```  


### Integrating the Global library in the Jenkins pipeline
1. Open the Jenkins server, navigate to Manage Jenkins, and select System.
2. Scroll to Global Trusted Pipelines Libraries
3. Add the name of the shared library and the default version.
4. Select Modern SCM as the Retrieval Method.
5. Select Git under Source Code Management.
6. Enter the Git repository URL for the shared library.
7. Add the credentials for Git access and click Save.
8. Edit the Jenkinsfile in the java-maven-app repository to reference the shared library as shown below:
   'jenkins-shared-library'-> The name of the library defined in the Jenkins-->System 
   ```bash
   @Library('jenkins-shared-library')
   ```
   <details><summary><strong> üí° Calling the Library  </strong></summary>
     Since we are using a global variable called gv to load the Groovy script, there is no need to add an underscore (_) at the end of @Library('jenkins-shared-library'). However, if the global variable gv is not defined, you must use @Library('jenkins-shared-library')_ instead
   </details>


### Integrating the shared library for a specific project
1. Open the Jenkins server, navigate to Manage Jenkins, and select System.
2. Scroll to Global Trusted Pipelines Libraries and delete the Global Trusted Pipelines Libraries details.
3. Open the Jenkinsfile and add the shared library reference at the beginning.
   
   ```bash
     library identifier: 'jenkins-shared-library@main', retriever: modernSCM(
      [$class: 'GitSCMSource',
       remote: 'https://github.com/lala-la-flaca/DevOpsBootcamp_8_Jenkins_SharedLibrary.git',
       credentialsId: 'github-credentials2'])
   ```

### Creating Jenkins Credentials to Access Git Using a Job




### Adding or Modifying Credentials in Jenkins Security Settings
The credentials can also be added or modified from the Security section under Credentials as follows:




### Creating a Freestyle Job for a Java Maven Application


### Pushing image to Docker Nexus Repository




### Creating a Pipeline Job for a Java Maven Application
